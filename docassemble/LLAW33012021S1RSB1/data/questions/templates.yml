  Core Supports help you with everyday activities, your current disability-related needs and to work towards your goals. It is broken into four different categories; assistance with daily life, transport, consumables, and assistance with daily social and community participation.
  
  *This information is current as of ${ current_date }.*
  
  <hr>
  ### <span class="header-num">1</span> Assistance with Daily Life
  Support for any activity you need assistance or help with. These include but are not limited to: 

  % for item in NDIS_services:
  % if item['category'] == 'Assistance with Daily Life':
    * [ ${ item['service'] } ](${ url_action('open_service', service=item['service']) })
  % endif
  % endfor 
  
  <hr>
  ### <span class="header-num">2</span> Transport Allowance
  This is a support that helps you travel to work or other places that will help you achieve the goals in your plan. How you can spend your transport funding and how it is paid to you (whether upfront or in regular payments) will be different for each person. Your Local Area Coordinator (LAC) will explain how you can use this budget.
  
  Transport funding is split into the 3 levels depending on your circumstances.  
  
  * **Level 1** = up to $1606 
  * **Level 2** = up to $2472 
  * **Level 3** = up to $3456  
  
  Transport funding money is only to be used for your personal transport purposes, but in most cases is provided depending on an individual’s ability to access public transport. It cannot pay for your carer or a family member to drive you around. It may include:
  
  % for item in NDIS_services:
  % if item['category'] == 'Transport':
    * [ ${ item['service'] } ](${ url_action('open_service', service=item['service']) })

# Displays the information about 'Capital Support'
template: template_capital
content: |
  Capital Supports are one of the three main funding categories that often cover the most expensive or complicated items. There is little flexibility regarding the funding as all funds must be reasonable and necessary. This means they must be directly related to your disability and give you clear benefits. There are two sub-categories under Capital Supports: Assistive Technology and Home Modifications.
 
  Pre-approval is required for equipment or home modifications. You will need to apply for capital support based on a quote presented with assessment.
 
  *This information is current as of ${ current_date }.*

  Examples might include:
  
  % for item in NDIS_services:
  % if item['category'] == 'Assistive Technology':
  % if item['ndis_level'] >= 2:
